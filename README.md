**title**: Why Nim is interesting and what I do with it

#### description

Why should someone be interested in a "niche" Tech, specifically a niche programming language? One reason is that it gives you an easy access to an interesting bunch of People and a different Culture to what you are used to. We will use the case of Nim and my involvement with it as motivation for you to explore and get involved in "niche" technologies. We will also briefly touch on the topics of Culture and People.

What is Nim? Nim is a statically typed and compiled programming language with a syntax similar to Python, compiles both natively AND to Javascript and has powerful metaprogramming that supports creation of DSLs. What do I do with it? I wanted in Nim a literate programming tool (like a Jupyter notebook) and I created a library for it (nimib) that later become an ecosystem (NimibLand) and I think it has good potential to create easily interactive documents (Explorables). And I have fun doing it with others.
