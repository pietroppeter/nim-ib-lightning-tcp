in terms of programming languages:

Rust... depends where you sit.
Nicheness is a continuumm a loosely defined
From my point of view it is graduating from Niche to Mainstream
With the side effect that C++ might become legacy...

I will be define it in subjective terms:
- you know very little people that do it (less than 5, normally 0)
- you can access a (small) community of enthusiasts

The goal of course is to conquer the world!

Will Nim become the next Python?

Spoiler: NO

But my goal is to convince you today that it might be interesting
to invest in a niche tech even discounting ultimate success
